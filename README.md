# Modelling and Implemnenting Reddit Data as a Relational Database.

This is an acadamic project for the course on Relational Database Management Systems RDBMS. We learned about the process of data modelling and implementaiton technqies of RDBMS such as ER diagrams, normalization, plsql etc. Through this project, we apply these concepts that we've learned, to a system similar to that of Reddit.

[A full Detailed Project report can be found here.](https://github.com/safeer2978/reddit_dbms/blob/main/report.pdf)



# We follow the following methodology for reddit.

Database Design:

1. Listing Functional Requirements of the System.
2. Listing Entities and Relationships
3. Desiging ER diagram
4. Deriving the Schema from ER Diagram
5. Listing Keys
6. Checking for anolomies and functional dependencies.
6. Normalization of Schema

Implementation:
0. Choose Database and check for Codd's Rules
1. Writing Create Queries with relevent datatypes and Constraints.
2. Creating Dummy Data and Insert queires.
5. Write Example Queeies for Use cases
3. Writing Functions
4. Writing Procedures
5. Wrting Triggers
